I used to reconstruct and perform Renaissance dances as a hobby.
For years, I thought it was the one thing I'd studied that I didn't apply to
my work in software.
As it turns out, I was applying it---I just didn't recognize it.

Working through an incident has a lot in common with performing a historical
dance.
We often don't really know or have experience of the system we're dealing
with (we just have manuscripts and static artwork in the case of Renaissance
dances).
To be successful, we need cope with uncertainty, coordinate with other
people, and constantly adapt in a dynamic situation.

My hobby was where I first learned how to deal with those types of conditions.
I'd encourage you to look at *your* hobbies, too, and see what you can learn
from them.
