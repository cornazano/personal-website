title: "Looking Beyond The Organization Boundary: Using Twitter for Discovery and Reinforcement"
summary: >
  2020-09-23.
  Targeted point-in-time training is fine for introducing known ideas,
  but it don't really make a difference in a team's daily work practices 
  or help them discover new ways of approaching their work.
  We need different techniques to support those needs.
---

A colleague recently observed that I'm often able to identify and introduce
helpful techniques and ideas from outside of our team's experience.
Then they asked an interesting question: how can *they* discover things
like that?
I'll try to give an idea of how I approach it and, since Twitter is a 
key part of this, recommend some people as a starting point for 
finding interesting discussions and resources.

---

There's a tendency, at least in the organizations I'm familiar with, 
for teams to draw heavily on their existing practices in work they
undertake, especially while dealing with time pressure and work overload.
Organization-internal expertise and training, plus a few select people
attending conferences, accounts for most of the formalized process of 
discovering how the industry is changing and adapting to new challenges.

These are, however, punctual activities.
They're not particularly effective at keeping those new ideas sufficiently 
in mind to apply them when appropriate, nor at helping a team alter their 
daily work habits.
Shifting those habits takes both regular exposure to reinforce the ideas, and 
the creation of some space to experiment with how we work.
I happen to use Twitter for part of this - in my experience, there's more 
relevant industry discussion going on there than on other social media 
platforms.

So why Twitter, rather than just recommending books, articles, and 
conference talks?

Back when I was doing my graduate work, I was always fascinated by the
asymmetry between finding what influenced a work I was reading and
what it influenced.
References and bibliographies are great; they let us trace down the
prior work, find out what other context was left out of the quotes, and 
what those authors were actually concerned with bringing into focus
with *their* work.
Finding the subsequent work, though, was harder.
More often than not, it involved getting pointers to recent material 
from faculty members in the field.

The same effect shows up here.
The references in specific talks and papers only look back in time,
and part of the goal is to be able to discover and explore new things.
Twitter can be helpful for this, but I find I need to use it intentionally
as a professional tool, not simply to "be on Twitter".
Here are some guidelines I suggest for using it this way:

* Read it regularly enough to harvest references and ideas, and
  to reinforce concepts you want to add to your mental toolbox.
* Be open to being influenced by at least some of what you read.
  This is the mechanism that allows it to support the reinforcement
  of new concepts you're trying to learn.
* Be selective in who you follow.

The last one is, I think, particularly important.
Your timeline should be something that helps you, not random noise that
overwhelms you.
Perhaps more importantly, I try to make sure that the people I follow
have values that align with mine.
If I'm going to be opening myself to being influenced, I want to keep some
control over who I allow to have that type of influence on me.

When choosing people to follow, I'm looking for three types of content:

* Advancing content. 
  Some of the people I follow should be sharing things that help me keep
  up with new developments in areas where I already have expertise.
* Broadening content.
  I want ideas from people in adjacent disciplines, especially where
  their ways of thinking bring different issues to the foreground
  for conscious reflection.
* Deepening content.
  I also want some content in my feed that is in areas I already know,
  but goes into more details than I generally use.

The rest of this post suggests some people to consider following
for various topics; think of it as a potential starter
kit for helping you discover new things and other people
beyond the boundary of your organization.

Mary shares a lot of resources about the field of developer relations,

Simon is well known for his work on mapping.
His regular discussions of doctrine and mapping have influenced how I think
about value production, prioritization, and engineering choices within our
technical stacks.
